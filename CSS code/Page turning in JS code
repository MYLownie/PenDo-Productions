Idea on how to change the images
the clickable zones have a counter on them. and everytime you click on one or the other the counter updates.
IE. if you click on next page, the counter goes from #1 to #2.
  coding would be: if(click==true && nextPage==true){
                      ++PageNumber;
                      }else{}
                   if{click==true && prevPage==true){
                    --PageNumber;
                    }
if you click on prev page it subtracts one from the current page.

to update the image wed have to orginize the images to display like so

img = PageNumber + "comic.png"

the comic pages will have to be named Page number then comic.png, like so (1comic.png, 2comic.png)
that way when we click and the page number is updated, it will force the image to be different.
